test programming language I'm working on. Pretty basic. Few non-conventional details:


- `struct` is `wafer`
- `char` is `byte`
- there's no `float`. just `double`. pls don't cry
- in order to promote manual labor and reduce laziness, to specify a function's return type, you use the `returns` keyword. So:

````rust    
fn add (int a, int b) returns int { ... }
````

check the test file for more syntax details
